# Tinygrad-By-Example
These files are meant for beginners to get up to speed on Tinygrad. I intend on doing the entire codebase in this format.

If you want to discuss this more I made a Community on Github or join my discord at https://discord.gg/dX34T2Jf 

where we mainly talk about AI and DevOps topics.
